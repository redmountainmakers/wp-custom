## RMM Custom Functionality

Plugin to store miscellaneous bits of RMM-specific code.

Currently:

- A stylesheet for CSS that is not related to our theme.
- A shortcode `[widget-location-text]` that displays either "on the right" or
  "at the bottom of the page" depending on the screen width.  It is used to
  point readers to content in the widget sidebar.
